# Next Buy - A fullstack E-commerce application üõí

Next Buy is a full-stack e-commerce website built with **TypeScript** and **Next.js**. The app features a smooth and modern user experience with lots of amazing features. The website was created as part of my journey to learn and explore TypeScript, Next.js, and full-stack development.

## Features ‚ú®

- **User Authentication**: Seamless user sign-up and login with **Clerk**.
- **Product Browsing**: Browse through a wide selection of products.
- **Product Search**: Easily search for products using the search bar.
- **Add to Cart**: Add items to your cart and update quantities with **real-time cost calculations**.
- **Favorites**: Add products to your favorites for quick access.
- **Reviews**: Leave and delete reviews on products. View all the reviews you've posted.
- **Social Sharing**: Share your favorite products directly on social media.
- **Order Placement**: Place an order (for now, the payment process redirects to my BuyMeACoffee page as the payment gateway is yet to be integrated).
